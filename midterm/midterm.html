Space is super big and mostly empty. It has planets, stars, and black holes that suck stuff up.

Earth is in space, orbiting the Sun, which is just one of billions of stars in our galaxy. And there are billions of galaxies out there!

Scientists send rockets and robots to explore, and maybe one day, weâ€™ll live on Mars. Space is wild and full of mysteries!
